WhatsDue is a WhatsApp bot that tells students what’s due, when, and where — using Microsoft Teams and Outlook.

Instead of checking 10 places, students just message WhatsDue.

“what’s due tomorrow?”
“do I have class today?”
“did sir post anything?”

WhatsDue answers in seconds.

What It Does
- Shows assignments and deadlines
- Tells today’s classes and meetings
- Reads professor announcements
- Finds files and links from Teams

All data comes directly from Microsoft Teams and Outlook.

WhatsApp is the chat.
Microsoft is the data.
WhatsDue connects them.

# Why It Exists

College info is scattered across Teams, Outlook, and emails.
Students miss things because it’s hard to track.

WhatsDue gives one simple place to ask:
“What’s due?”
